    Overview:

        Shader program 'hitboxcube':
            Get shader desc: hitboxcube_shader_desc(sg_query_backend());
            Vertex shader: hitboxcube_vs
                Attribute slots:
                    ATTR_hitboxcube_vs_pos = 0
                Uniform block 'vs_params':
                    C struct: vs_params_t
                    Bind slot: SLOT_vs_params = 0
            Fragment shader: hitboxcube_fs


    Shader descriptor structs:

        sg_shader hitboxcube = sg_make_shader(hitboxcube_shader_desc(sg_query_backend()));

    Vertex attribute locations for vertex shader 'hitboxcube_vs':

        sg_pipeline pip = sg_make_pipeline(&(sg_pipeline_desc){
            .layout = {
                .attrs = {
                    [ATTR_hitboxcube_vs_pos] = { ... },
                },
            },
            ...});

    Image bind slots, use as index in sg_bindings.vs_images[] or .fs_images[]


    Bind slot and C-struct for uniform block 'vs_params':

        vs_params_t vs_params = {
            .mvp = ...;
        };
        sg_apply_uniforms(SG_SHADERSTAGE_[VS|FS], SLOT_vs_params, &SG_RANGE(vs_params));
